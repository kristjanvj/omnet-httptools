#summary Build and installation instructions

= Installation =

First of all, get the latest version of the INET framework. Create a couple of directories under the INET root as ldss_tools and ldss_networks. Copy the sources into the directories.


= Build =

Run ./makemake from the INET root to make sure the makefiles are up-to-date. Then run make in the ldss_components directory, followed by a make for the INET framework.


= Notes =

The instructions given here work but are probably less than elegant. Input on better procedures for install and build would be greatly appreciated.
