#summary Build and installation instructions

= Installation and build =

Note: The instructions are for a Linux system. 

*Get the INET framework.* I am using version 20061020. Build according to the instructions
{{{
./makemake
make
}}}
and try a few examples from Examples to see if everythin works according to plan.

*Get the !HttpTools source.* From within your INET directory, get the source from the subversion repository by entering 
{{{
svn checkout http://omnet-httptools.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ httptools
}}}

*Modify the makemakefiles file.* In your favorite editor, modify the _makemakefiles_ file in the INET root. Add the following lines to the end of the inetbase section:
{{{
cd httptools && $(MAKEMAKE) $(OPTS) -n -r $(ALL_INET_INCLUDES) -X Documentation -X Tests -X Examples 
}}}

*You will need to do a makemake and make again to build the INET framework with HttpTools

= Notes =

The instructions given here work but are probably less than elegant. Input on better procedures for install and build would be greatly appreciated.
